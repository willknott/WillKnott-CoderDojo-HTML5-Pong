Bubble Tennis was created for a series of Classes in CoderDojo Mahon/NSC

The reason for all the class1 to class 10 was to have incrementing code avilable for the kids (as the don't get the versioning system yet).

Bubble Tennis (.html and .js) are versioned with the changes.

Its a simple virtual tennis game between Red Lemonade and her sister White Lemonade. As the score rises their bottles fill with liquid (red and white). 

The class was for HTML5 canvas games
teaching
Drawing to the canvas
Animation
Keyboard input
Bounding / colision calculations
loops and conditionals
And its easy to adapt (virtual sizing and positioning for full screen regardless of screen size)
